> "Create a website!" - My brain on bash.
## About

CSPAAS is a coming soon page generator you can use wherever/whenever/however.
The whole thing weighs in at 7kb and produces an html file of 7-8kb. Complete with countdown timer and social media links.

##### What's good about it then?

* Way too easy to use.
* No jQuery.
* Blazing fast.
* HTML5 valid.
* CSS3 Animations.
* Doesn't eat the cat.

## Requirements
* Curl
* A need for a coming soon page
## Usage

 Simply pop this is your terminal and follow the prompts.
```
bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/sstmcspgaas)
```
## Recommended Usage

Just to make it even more stupidly easy we'll create an alias so all you'll have to type is 3 letters to initiate the script. Enter these one by one. Feel free to edit your alias to your needs or just stick with the mighty "csp".
### OSX
```
sudo nano ~/.bash_profile
```
Add this to the bottom.
```
alias csp='bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/sstmcspgaas)'
```
And refresh
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```
### Linux
```
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```
Add this to the bottom.
```
alias csp='bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/sstmcspgaas)'
```
And refresh
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Windows
I'll get round to this. I think it's called doskey, registry edit and a .bat file somewhere. Eugh!
